**3.User issue and problem**

We will list about 5 types of people to address the problems which they are encountering in their daily life

Bob

Bob is a social media user; His major fear is of being spied. He doesn&#39;t trust existing social media because it has poor security and can be breached easily. He doesn&#39;t make sensive calls nor chats with his family and friends. The Constant advertisements, bombarding with centralized ads annoys him. Sometimes he sees adverts about the things he talks offline; this makes him to doubt that does centralized apps taps microphones?

Solution: A Trustless social media which is decentralized, secure encryption, Ad-free and doesn&#39;t take a single byte of user&#39;s data. This necessarily doesn&#39;t mean someone have to create a decentralized clone of Instagram, Twitter or TikTok, but to provide a new way of engaging social media platform competing existing corporate social medias.

John

John is a crypto holder. He buys cryptocurrencies through centralized exchanges attempting a very long process through multiple platforms. He then holds most of his coins on centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase. He doesn&#39;t trust the platforms as his holdings are in custody by the companies which can be hacked anytime losing private keys to potential hackers. He asks us &quot;Is there any trustless exchanges for fiat currencies?&quot;

Solution: A trustless centralized exchange with easy withdrawals to hot wallets (Metamask / Non-Custodial) and holding users funds through protocols such as Multi-Sig Wallets and Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing Scheme to hold private keys is a better approach for a semi-centralized exchange.

# Mary<a name="introduction"></a>

Mary is interested in blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs. She is not sure if she could take a bet on the crypto world. She sees tutorials, and reads articles about how to use cryptocurrencies. She finds it tough as she has to go through multiple different platforms such as CEXs, Hot Wallets, DEXs, Liquidity Pools, Public Addresses, L2 Solutions, etc. She wants to use crypto effectively but she backs out just because she finds it overwhelming.

Solution: To Build a Unified Platform which has built in features to buy,sell, exchange, send users who will find it simple like a web2 app using usernames to transact and without watching any tutorials or reading long articles

Steve

Steve is a NFT Guy. He flips NFTs on centralized NFT Marketplaces which has a chance of banning projects if they wish to. He also goes to his friends and tells about his recent NFT purchase and how he is the owner but they certainly don&#39;t understand it. He wants his friends and the whole world to use NFT Marketplaces so that he can get the social identity he expects. But he knows that NFT Marketplaces are like Ecommerce Platforms which won&#39;t get high user adoption similar to other social applications which gives Social Identity to the User

Solution: Building a Decentralized NFT Marketplace to counter censorship of projects and democratizing NFTs to masses using a social media application that gives the owner a Social Identity that they own a specific NFT which can get a high resale value.

Ava

Ava is a teenager who wants to kick in to the Metaverse and blockchain world but she lacks the capital to invest and worried about gas fees as every transaction requires the native coin which she should have always in reserve. She also fears about volatility while sending coins to her friends. She wants a Premium Service Application without the need to invest.

Solution: To build a Blockchain which doesn&#39;t require Native coin for fees and takes a not-so-considerable amount of validator fees to almost zero for confirming the transaction. To bring in an integrated stable coin for transfers to solve volatility while paying friends, family and businesses. By Airdropping free cryptocurrencies to almost all users will solve the inability to invest in coins.

**4.Unified Mobile application - An intro to viral**

Short intro

A Next-Gen Social Media platform bridging interactive media, NFTs, and blockchain technologies&#39; underlying applications into a Daily Internet User-Based App

Every media shared on viral is a unique NFT where it can be utilized to create limitless possibilities across the platform. Users can share ultra-short to short videos, thoughts through text, sell NFTs and also make communication between one-on-one, private groups and, public channels with complete true privacy.

Viral users will be benefitted from zero ads, cryptographic encryption, censorship-resistant and, also use cryptocurrencies throughout the platform. Every user is a contributor to the platform where they receive rewards and incentives in Viral Coin for running the decentralized social media.

We are bridging Social Media with Blockchain, Wallets, Exchanges and NFT Markeplace to bring the ultimate one-app for the common masses to adop into the tolkenized economy

**7.Social media &amp; User Experience**

Viral is a multi-media sharing decentralized social network that brings meta-experience with friends, family and other people to communicate, share posts and send messages across the globe with absolute privacy. Viral sets NFT as a standard for every post that shared in the network which intends to bring interactive social experience and utility use cases of blockchain environment.

Note : To bring NFT as a standard for a social media post doesn&#39;t necessarily means it should be sold for tokens, rather it is a unique piece of data in blockchain that gives the power of ownership which the user can keep himself or can be transferred to others if the user wants to via Open Bidding/Selling

Privacy Groups

Privacy Groups is a unique feature in Viral to create unlimited friend&#39;s groups as list to ensure maximum privacy for users to post and share shots, drops, thoughts, NFTs to the particular groups of users i.e., Family, Friends, Close Friends, Besties, etc. This feature can enable complete privacy over viewers for certain posts.

Visual Representation

Bob has 2 posts (Family &amp; Friends) â€“ He creates 2 privacy groups (Family &amp; Friends) â€“ When he posts he select Family and posts â€“ His Family can only see the post â€“ When he posts 2nd post he&#39;ll select Friends â€“ His Friends can only see the post â€“ When a Friend visits his profile he can&#39;t see Bob&#39;s Family post and vice versa

\*\*GunDB Snippet\*\*

Audio Emoji

This is a short feature where all the emoji&#39;s in Viral if touched will give a short sound of the emoji. This will be available on chats &amp; comments section of a post.

Interest Based Recommendation

To make the viral platform more user-friendly interest-based recommendations are used. We have numerous ways to fetch interest from a user without collecting data on a centralized server, some of them are

- Like &amp; Dislike
- Hashtag Follows
- Search-Based Interests
- Based on Activity
- Shares with other friends
- Following interests
- Based on Comments

All the user interests will be stored locally on the device to ensure maximum security and will be taken to show recommendations.

User Security &amp; Privacy

This is classified into

    1. Media Storage (Breach of Private Accounts Post)
    2. Chats or Private Messages
    3. Interests of User
    4. Chat backups

Media Storage

Visual Representation

Mike Uploads Media â€“ File Gets Encrypted in his mobile â€“ Decryption Key stored on his post database â€“ Encrypted File uploaded to IPFS which will be stored decentralized â€“ Followers only can only decrypt and view the post

All Media uploaded to Viral is End-to-end Encrypted where all the files are encrypted using Symmetric AES-256 Encryption Standard on the device and gets uploaded to Trusted IPFS Cluster Nodes. Thus promising security of media which cannot be decrypted by classical computers.

Chats &amp; Private Messages

For Chat-based encryption, we use public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. There are no centralized cloud-based servers involved in storing messages which can potentially leak private chats and messages. Every single message is encrypted and can be only decrypted by the receiver.

Public-Private key encryption more secure than a single shared key used in multiple chat platforms.

Visual Representation

Alice writes &quot;Hello&quot; to Bob â€“ Bob Receives an encrypted message - Bob decrypts using his private key â€“ Bob Sees &quot;Hello&quot; from Alice

GunDB Explanatory Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SiLnaSDkh4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SiLnaSDkh4)

Interests of User

Users&#39; interests will be saved locally on their devices ensuring full privacy of personal data.

Chat Backup

Since Viral is a Offline-First Chat messages will not be stored in cloud. To Backup messages Viral will offer cloud options such as Google Drive/Dropbox where you can securely encrypt and save your backup. While Migrating to another mobile we will be providing a feature to transfer existing messages/interest to your new device.

Phase 2 Development

We will be focussing on Quantum Resilience of all media encryption used in Viral while commencing the Phase 2 of Development Roadmap

TOR/VPN Anonymity

Viral will be a safe haven for anonymity, privacy, and security in eliminating the tracing of users&#39; identities by exploiters . Users can benefit from TOR &amp; VPN Routing Features built in our Decentralized application to hide their IP address and go fully anonymous.

Visualization

How TOR Works

TOR routes you through several additional nodes while encrypted, no one can trace it back to you. VPN will redirect your internet traffic through a secure tunnel, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data in the process.

**Viral Smart Chain â€“ IOTA Layer 2**

Viral Smart Chains, is a network of horizontally scalable EVM Chains on top of IOTA Tangle used for Viral Social network with fully deployed defi ecosystem with Off-Chain solutions. Viral Smart Chains aim to provide an easy understandable one-platform for all the non-crypto users who are subjected to higher gas fees, congestion in network, volatility and scattered defi solutions.

Short Features of Viral Smart Chains

IOTA Smart Contract Protocol

Basic Intro

IOTA provides an Off-Chain Smart Contract Solution for developers to create multiple-chains on Top of IOTA&#39;s immutable Tangle. Since Ethereum transactions are processed On-chain by every single node on its network, it faces additional congestion, slow transaction time and subject to higher miner fees. IOTA&#39;s off-chain smart contract solution makes use of blockchains anchored to the Tangle where the smart contracts are ran and achieved consensus with small set of committee nodes. This achieves a high scalable throughput and immutable records since the states of smart contracts such as Account Balances, Input Conditions and Consequences over time are updated on IOTA&#39;s Tangle.

Architecture

There are several components to understand more about IOTA&#39;s Smart Contracts Protocol. It gives us multi-chain functionality to run smart contracts from different chains which allows a horizontal scaling of blockchains without a need for plasma or side chains.

Consensus and Validators

IOTA&#39;s Smart Contract Chain uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Algorithm, which guarantees consistency and byzantine fault tolerance if less than â…“ of nodes are malicious. So the verification process runs on Nodes within a chain committee. With a Proof-of-Stake Consensus each Viral chain will be run by a network of validator nodes, which run a consensus on the chain state updates. The validators of the chain (Nodes) form a committee, a bound together closed set of nodes. The committee of the chain can allow new validators and validator nodes to be added or replaced. This also makes the chain itself agnostic to its validators (the committee).

Viral Smart Chains leverages IOTA Tangle&#39;s properties of scalability, high throughput, feeless transactions and immutable records. Only when a supermajority of the validators (the quorum) of a chain reaches [consensus](https://wiki.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/core_concepts/consensus), the results get added to the chain where a new state update can be signed, which unlocks the AliasOutput for the chain and produces the next state UTXO which is stored on the Tangle as an immutable record. In summary, the chain&#39;s state (data) will be stored on Tangle as an immutable record.The amount of the validators to reach a consensus is configurable for each chain. The committee itself can also be variable in size - from a few nodes up to hundreds of nodes, and each node can be part of many different committees.

Validators â€“ Each Single Node running the Chain

Committee â€“ The Group of Nodes running a chain

Quorum â€“ Number of Nodes to be in consensus to validate a transaction

Viral Smart Chains

Intro

Viral Smart Chains are a family of separate chains anchored to the IOTA&#39;s Tangle where each chain can communicate with each other via intermediary L1 Value Tangle.

Viral&#39;s Approach

A Single chain will seem complex for setting different fees for different actions on the blockchain i.e Smart Contract Calls/Deployment, Sending Tokens to other Address, etc. Viral&#39;s approach is to bring multiple chains categorized by its purpose to serve the Viral Application with fee structure thereby also creating separate chains to provide zero network fees for minting NFTs on Viral App (ERC721 &amp; ERC1155) while rewarding the validators of all Viral chains (including zero fee chains) from the miner pool (total collected fees of all chains) based on validator&#39;s total validated transactions for the day through an automated smart contract.

Validators

Viral Chains will work on Proof-of-stake consensus where validators (miners) are required to stake their Viral Coins in order to participate in the network for validating transactions. The mining power in proof-of stake depends on the amount of coins a validator is staking. Participants who stake more Viral Coins will be most likely to be chosen to add more blocks. When a transaction is validated and attain consensus by the quorum of validators (Read IOTA Protocol), the state of the transaction/smart contract will be recorded in the Value Tangle&#39;s UTXO Ledger which makes it immutable. The Transaction will be secured by the validators inside the Viral chain and also the L1 UTXO Ledger.

Fees

Viral Smart Chain is built primarily to ease the need for gas-based transaction fees like other smart contract blockchains. Transaction fees are only leaved as a fixed percentage as &quot;transfer fee&quot; in Viral Smart Chains for Sending, receiving tokens between accounts and smart contracts.

Transfer fees are fixed at 0.05% of transfer value of the tokens paid in Viral native coin. The minimum fee is capped at $0.0005 of the fiat value of Viral Coin which is determined using price oracles.

Visualization

Native Token : Bob wants to transfer 100VRL to John : Fee leaved will be 0.05 VRL

Other Tokens : If 1 vMATIc = 0.1 VRL

Mike wants to transfer 6000 vMATIC to Mia : Fee leaved will be 0.30075 VRL (approx. 3.0075 MATIC) including Swap and Transfer Fee

NFT Chains

Currently on popular smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon the amount of gas required for a transaction is determined by the demand for the transaction to be included, regardless of what type of transaction it is where it is dynamically adjusted based on number of user&#39;s interacting with the network at the time.

This brings us to an effect that a single blockchain cannot set certain fees or eliminate gas fees for a particular type or category of a transaction regardless of it&#39;s nature i.e, smart contract, account transfer. Multiple parallel state blockchains can solve this issue by altering few blockchains as permissioned for a certain use cases and can make it feeless without hindering the other fee-based chains.

Viral&#39;s aim to democratize NFT to the masses and bring massive NFT Adoption we will be running separate zero-fee chains for deploying ERC721 &amp; ERC1155 Token directly from the Viral Application. The Validators for the chain will be open to join the network where they&#39;ll be rewarded from the miner pool (total fee collected) based on the total transactions they validate in a day.

Family of Chains

Genesis Chain : Initialization of First Chain with Viral Coin and Stable Coin Deployment with Smart Contracts that defines governance, fees, etc

General Chains : For Every n number of active Viral Wallet users a new general chain is deployed. These chains are used to store user funds and create new accounts on the blockchains. So Users can do intra and inter chain transactions with high throughput and flexible scaling.

DeFI Chains

Smart Contract Deployment Chains specifically for categorized DApps

DEX Chain : Running smart contracts for Viral Wallet&#39;s Decentralized Exchange

ERC20 Chain : To Deploy new ERC20 Tokens that can be transacted between chains and accounts

Viral NFT Chain : Feeless Viral ran Smart Contract Chain specifically to deploy user&#39;s NFTs on-chain

ERC721/115 Chain : To deploy new Non-Fungible Tokens for other platforms outside the Viral Application

Marketplace Chain : To create smart contract based marketplaces for NFTs and much more

Other Chains : For creating Dapps for lending, asset tokenization, yield farming, tools and infrastructure, etc

Tokens

Native Token

Viral Coin is the native currency, a digital coin that does all the operations inside the Viral Smart Chains. It is used to store value, send and receive funds within the Multi-Chain Viral Blockchains. Viral Coin is used for paying fees inside the network, staking, governance, rewards and much more.

Viral Stable Coin

Viral Stable Coin is a sub-native token, an algorithmic stable coin pegged to the US Dollar that is widely used in the Viral Application for sending and receiving tokens across users wallets. Due to constant volatility of the crypto market there is a barrier for the common people and businesses to get into cryptocurrencies. As Viral&#39;s aim to become the one-stop crypto solution for the masses we are providing a way for the user&#39;s to automatically transact in Stable Coin without any complex need for swapping their current tokens. In Short, when an user transact in Viral Coin, it will force swap and send the receiver viral stable coins to avoid depreciating of the asset while transacting.

As far as we know there are several stable coins are in the market 1.Fiat-Peg Centralized, 2.Crypto Collateral 3. Algorithmic. In our case we can take 3 coins 1. USDC 2. DAI 3. AMPL. USDC maintains the peg but holds the funds on its reserves centralized which comes with its demerits. DAI aims to maintain the peg using collateral of several crypto coins, in which USDC hold the reserve of more than 50% of the DAI&#39;s crypto backing, which also makes DAI a centralized cryptocurrency. AMPL is an algorithmic stable coin which maintains it&#39;s peg by contracting and expanding it&#39;s supply of tokens to achieve stability, this achieves true decentralization but fails to operate swiftly for sudden price movements due to it&#39;s rebase function ran in a stipulated time and also rebases in a slow, long way which takes upto a week after a sudden price movement. This is where most crypto projects fail to provide a decentralized stable currency for the masses.

Terra blockchain is the most successful running algorithmic stable coin which maintain its stability by changing the stable coin&#39;s supply by burning and minting it&#39;s native token LUNA. In better words, when Terra (Stable Coin) demand increases to more than $1, Luna (Native token) will be burned and New Terra tokens will be minted, where increase in supply of tokens resolves the demand and maintains the peg of the stable coin and vice versa. Viral Stable Coin adopts the algorithmic stable coin algorithm used in many of Terra&#39;s stable coins.

Viral Coin and Viral Stable Coin will be the two primary coins in the Viral Social Platform. The supply and demand of Stable Coin is always balanced by making Viral Coin as it&#39;s variable counterweight that absorbs it&#39;s volatility.

1 VSC \&gt; $1 (Expansion) : When Viral Stable Coin trades at a price that is high relative to it&#39;s $1 peg i.e., $1.15, the demand for VSC is higher than the circulating supply. To bring the peg back to $1, the supply of VSC should be increased to balance the demand. During Expansion State trading bots will mint VSC by burning VRL, which has an effect of lowering Viral Stable Coin Price (by expanding the supply) and increases the Viral Coin price (by reducing it&#39;s supply). The smart contracts will trade until the price peg of 1 VSC = $1 is achieved.

1 VSC \&lt; $1 (Contraction) : When Viral Stable Coin trades at a price that is low relative to it&#39;s $1 peg i.e., $0.95, the demand for VSC is lower for the circulating supply. To bring the peg back to $1, the supply of VSC should be decreased to balance the demand. During Contraction State trading bots will burn VSC and mints VRL, which has an effect of increasing Viral Stable Coin Price (by reducing it&#39;s supply) and lowering the Viral Coin price (by expanding it&#39;s supply). The smart contracts will trade until the price peg of 1 VSC = $1 is achieved.

Viral Stable Trading App

High Frequency trading cannot be run using automated smart contracts to maintain price peg of Viral Stable Coin. Users can stake their Coins, run automated arbitrage trading and receive profits using the Viral Stable Trading Application a separate application to maintain the peg of Viral Stable Coin

Users will be able to stake both coins VRL &amp; VSC proportionally to a smart contract in the mobile app which process all transactions of burning and minting VRL for VSC automatically without the need for user signature and receive profits from arbitrage opportunities by minting the burning the coins to balance the volatility. The Smart Contracts will add &amp; subtract coins on each pools to maintain stability.

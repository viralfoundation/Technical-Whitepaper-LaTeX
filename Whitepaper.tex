\section{User Problems \& Basic Solutions}
This is a Sample Problems of the Viral Project.

\section{Vision Statement}
To bring blockchain \& crypto adoption to the masses we would got to bridge social communication with defi and tokenised economy. The Viral Network of Applications standards are designed in such a way that our vision to bring an proficient, user-friendly mobile application will combine several divisions of decentralized protocols that can lead to an ultimate tool for crypto acknowledgement. The divisions which we are focussing to rebuild is listed\\
\\
\textbf{\large Social Media}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To create a Real-world Decentralised Social Media
\item To construct an Autonomous self-evolving platform
\item To construct an Interactive Next-Gen Social Media
To form a clean people-owned platform appropriate for all age groups
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{\large Crypto Adoption}
\begin{enumerate}

\section{Unified Mobile Application - An Intro to Viral}

\hyperlink{https://sample.com}{App Brouchure}\\

\textit{Images}\\

A Next-Gen Social Media platform bridging interactive media, NFTs, and blockchain technologies' underlying applications into an every-day user-based mobile app. Viral bridges Social Media with Blockchain, Wallets, Exchanges and NFT Markeplaces to bring the ultimate one-app for the common masses to adopt into the tokenised economy.\\

Every media shared on viral is an unique NFT where it can be utilized to create limitless achievable outcomes across the platform. Users can share ultra-short to short videos, thoughts through text, sell NFTs and additionally make communication between one-on-one, private groups and, open channels with total genuine privacy. App users will be benefitted from zero ads, cryptographic encryption, censorship-resistant and, also get to use various cryptocurrencies throughout the platform. Every user is an active contributor to the platform by which they receive rewards (payment) in Viral Coin for effectively utilizing the Viral Application and it's child platforms.\\

\section{How Whitepaper Structured}
For an efficient understanding, we have seperated the Viral Architecture/Ecosystem's major sectors.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Social Media \& User Experience (Page 1-10)
\item Blockchain, Token Ecosystem \& Layer 2 (Page 10-15)
\item Smart Wallet (Page 15-20)
\item Child Platforms (Page 20-25)

\end{itemize}

\section{Social media \& User Experience}
Viral is a multi-media sharing decentralized social network that brings meta-experience with friends, family and other people to communicate, share posts and send messages across the globe with absolute privacy. Viral sets Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFT) as a standard for every post that shared in the network which intends to bring interactive social experience and utility use cases of blockchain environment.\\

\notte{To bring NFT as a standard for a social media post doesn't essentially implies it ought to be sold for tokens, rather it conveys that each post in Viral is a unique piece of data in the blockchain that gives the power of ownership of the user which if needed can be opted to transfer in exchange for tokens inside the Viral Platform.\texttt{notte}.}

\subsection{Engagements}

\textbf{Like, Comment, Share, Tip}\\

Users can like, comment, share, reThought, and also tip Tokens to their favorite posts and influencers. The number of likes will influence the recommendations list of other users.\\

Additionally a hidden engagement dislike will be added to every post but won't be visible to the users/nor owners, which is exclusively utilized for interest-based algorithm to filter out disliked content\\

\textit{Algorithm/Mathematical formula for recommendation engine}\\

\textbf{Tip}\\

The tipping feature in Viral engagements tip/support user's favourite influencers' contents. It works as a donation/reward where all the tips will be directly sent to the receivers wallet. Users can send tokens of their own choice to reward other users content on the platform.

Viral will charge commisions on Tips and deposits it to the reward pool. These commissions are calculated in such a way where the percentage varies depending on the end face value.\\

The tipping amount will be round of to tens and will leave the commision on both seperated amounts.\\

$Formula$\\

The Charges are\\


(Ending with 1,2)\$ tips     - 22\%      i.e., 11, 62, 761, 952\\
(Ending with 3,4,5)\$ tips   - 19\%      i.e., 23, 64, 765, 953\\
(Ending with 6,7,8,9)\$ tips - 17\%      i.e., 16, 48, 27,  79\\
(Ending with 0)\$ tips       - 12\%      i.e., 10, 60, 720, 1000\\


For example: If a user is tips worth 57\$ then the commissions charged will be:\\

For the first     50\$ - 12\%\\
And the remaining 7\$  - 17\%\\
